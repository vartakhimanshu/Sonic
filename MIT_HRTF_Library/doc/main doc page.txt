/*! \mainpage mit_hrtf_lib - MIT Kemar HRTF C Library

\section about_sec About

This is a C library making access to the MIT Kemar HRTF set easy, through
the use of two functions. It is based on the "compact" data sets, which are
trimmed to 128 taps at 44100Hz, from the the complete set of 512 taps. While
Aristotel Digenis wrote this library, all the data itself is thanks to the
work done at MIT by Bill Gardner and Keith Martin. All this library aims to
do is to make the use of that data simpler.

The original data available from the MIT website is stored in individual
".wav" files, at 44100Hz sample rate. For creation of this library, resampled
version were made. At this point there were 2944 files, so a Python script 
was then written to iterate through all the files, sorting them and creating
multi-dimensional C arrays out of them. Next, the mechanism for returning the
appropriate array elements was written and tested.

\section use_sec Use
There are only two functions for use. Have a look at the example code below,
or see mit_hrtf_lib.h for more information on their use.

<CODE>
int nAzimuth = 30;<br>
int nElevation = 0;<br>
int nTaps = 0;<br>
short* pLeft = 0;<br>
short* pRight = 0;<br>
<br>
nTaps = mit_hrtf_availability(nAzimuth, nElevation, 44100, 0);<br>
<br>
if(nTaps)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pLeft = malloc(nTaps * sizeof(short));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pRight = malloc(nTaps * sizeof(short));<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nTaps = mit_hrtf_get(&nAzimuth, &nElevation, 44100, 0, pLeft, pRight);<br>
}<br>
<br>
if(pLeft)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free(pLeft);<br>
if(pRight)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free(pRight);<br>
</CODE>
